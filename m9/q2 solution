(Missing Attribute)
The Vehicle entity is missing an attribute specifying the transmission type, thus the VehTransType attribute has been added.

(Ambiguous naming)
Customer entity does not differentiate between the customer's cellphone number and primary phone number, CustPhone has therefore been changed to CustCellPhone and CustPrimaryPhone.

(Strong Entity)
The Account entity is defined as a weak entity, although it does not depend on Expense or Payment entities, and has therefore been changed to a strong entity type.

(Composite Primary Key)
Because the customer can make multiple payments on the same invoice, the PayMethod attribute has also been added as part of the primary key for the Payment entity.

(Ambiguous Relationships) 
The problem statement does not specify any relationship between the employee entity and vehicle entity, nor the payment entity and the vehicle entity. Those relationships have therefore been removed.


(Cardinalities)
The cardinalities specified from Expense to Account have been changed because an Account can have more than one expense, and an Expense has exactly one associated Account. However a newly created Account may have no expenses yet and so the minimum cardinality from Account to Expense is zero.

The problem statement clearly specifies that each Payment is associated with exactly one account, therefore the cardinality has been changed to a min and max of one from Payment to Account. The maximum cardinality from Account to Payment should also be many because an account can make multiple payments.


The Employee entity specifies a minimum cardinality of one on the Payment entity. This has been changed to zero because if a newly hired employee does not make a sale or process any payments, they will not have a Payment.
